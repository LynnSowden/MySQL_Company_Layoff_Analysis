In this project, I used MySQL to clean data on company layoffs from 2020-2023. I then completed a full exploratory data analysis. 
To clean the data, I created a duplicate table to complete my work on. Then, I found and removed duplicates, 
standardized the data by making sure all company names, countries, etc. were spelled the same way, 
removed null/blank values, and removed columns and rows. 
The skills I practiced in this project are aggregate functions, Window functions, CTEs, CREATE TABLE, TRIM, UPDATE, STR_TO_DATE, ALTER TABLE, DELETE, SUBSTRING, and DENS_RANK.
Through this analysis, I looked at layoffs by company, industry, and country. I learned that the United States had more layoffs than any other country during this time.
The highest hit industries were consumer and retail. The lowest hit industries were fin-tech and manufacturing.
I also ranked the total layoffs by company and year to see that 2022 and 2023 were particularly bad years for layoffs.

This data came from Alex the Analyst's Data Analyst Bootcamp.
